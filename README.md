# Lobot
Lobot was a Human male who served as the chief administrative aide to Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian on Cloud City over the planet Bespin. His brain was connected to the city's central computer which allowed him to communicate directly with the city's computer network. In this capacity, he served as the city's first and only computer-liaison officer.

Due to this I have decided to name my diagnostic scnanner after him.
